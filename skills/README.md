# Skills

This directory contains staged public copies of selected local Codex skills.

Each skill is stored in its own directory and must include:

- `SKILL.md`;
- YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`;
- optional `README.md` for user-facing install, usage, and publication notes
  when a skill is published, operationally complex, or packaged as a plugin;
- optional `agents/openai.yaml`;
- optional `references/`, `scripts/`, or requirements files when the skill needs supporting material.

README files are not required for every skill. Do not add one when it would
only duplicate `SKILL.md` or `references/`.

Current staged skill READMEs:

- [`fpf-work-guide/README.md`](fpf-work-guide/README.md)
- [`doc-to-md/README.md`](doc-to-md/README.md)

The source of truth for the staged list is [`../skills-index.md`](../skills-index.md).

The layer model is [`../docs/skill-artifact-model.md`](../docs/skill-artifact-model.md). Local automation around a skill, including `fpf-work-guide` session-start hooks or workspace launchers, is not a staged public skill overlay. Keep those files outside `skills/` unless they become an explicitly reviewed public skill artifact.
