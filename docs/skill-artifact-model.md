# Skill Artifact Model

## Purpose

Use this model when publishing, installing, validating, or reviewing Codex skills in this repository.

A skill can exist in several related layers. These layers must not be collapsed into one "skill" object, because each layer has a different audience, trust boundary, and publication rule.

## Layers

| Layer | Typical location | Purpose | Publication rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public staged copy | `skills/<name>/` in this repository | Reviewed public artifact for installation, issue discussion, and reuse. `SKILL.md` is the executable routing contract; optional `README.md` is user/maintainer documentation for published, operationally complex, or plugin-packaged skills. | May be committed and published after validation and manual diff review. |
| Plugin distribution artifact | `plugins/<name>/` plus `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` | Installable Codex package for sharing one or more public skills beyond a local checkout. Bundled skill copies include the same optional skill README as the staged source when that README exists. | May be committed and published after plugin validation and manual diff review. |
| Installed operational copy | `$HOME/.agents/skills/<name>/`, `$REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills/<name>/`, `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/<name>/`, or another agent-specific runtime location | Active local copy loaded by Codex or another agent in a user environment. | Not automatically public; may drift from the staged copy. |
| Private overlay skill | `$HOME/.agents/skills/<name>-private/`, `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/<name>-private/`, or another clearly private skill name | Personal defaults, local workflows, private fixtures, or user-specific policy layered on top of a public skill. | Never publish unless deliberately converted into a reviewed public skill. |
| Private local policy file | `private/local-policies/<name>.md`, private notes, or another approved private repository path | Advisory user-specific defaults for an existing public skill, without creating a second skill. | Never publish in public skill or plugin artifacts; may be versioned only in a private repository. |
| Runtime dependency layer | `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/tools/`, `~/.local/bin`, system packages, venvs, external CLIs | Executables and libraries used by skill scripts. | Document requirements; do not treat installed binaries or venvs as staged skill source. |
| Cache and state layer | `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/cache`, `.fpf-update/`, `~/.local/state`, logs | Local refresh state, fetched mirrors, cache status, evidence of recent runs, and diagnostics. | Never publish as skill source; use only as local evidence or troubleshooting context. |
| Personal automation layer | workspace launchers, shell aliases, cron/launchd jobs, Codex automations, local wrapper jobs | Convenience automation that invokes an installed operational copy or its scripts. | Not a public skill overlay; public skills must not depend on it. |
| Generated output layer | converted documents, reports, temp directories, user outputs, generated audit bundles | Results produced by using a skill. | Not part of the skill unless intentionally added as reviewed fixtures or examples. |
| Upstream source layer | package indexes, GitHub source repos, FPF mirrors, third-party docs | External sources used to install, refresh, or verify skill behavior. | Pin, cite, or disclose as needed; do not confuse upstream source with local staged skill content. |

## Dependency Direction

Allowed dependency direction:

```text
public staged copy
  -> plugin distribution artifact
  -> installed operational copy
    -> runtime dependencies
    -> cache and state
    -> generated outputs
    -> personal automation
    -> private overlay skill
    -> private local policy file
```

Private overlays and personal automation may depend on a public, plugin-distributed, or installed skill. Public staged skills and plugin distribution artifacts must not depend on private overlays, personal automation, local cache/state, generated outputs, or machine-specific paths.

Private local policy files follow the same dependency direction as private overlays: they may refer to public skill behavior, but public staged skills and plugin artifacts must not require them.

## Review Rules

- Review `skills/<name>/` as a publication artifact, not as a live mirror of the local machine.
- Review `plugins/<name>/` as an installable package, not as a local runtime state dump.
- Validate an installed operational copy separately when diagnosing local behavior.
- Treat private overlay skills as local policy and convenience. They can document personal defaults but must not redefine public command semantics.
- Treat private local policy files as advisory preferences for an operator or agent. They are not separate skills and must not redefine public command semantics.
- Treat runtime dependencies as prerequisites or install outputs, not as bundled skill source unless they are small reviewed scripts under `skills/<name>/scripts/`.
- Treat cache/state files and logs as evidence carriers for a local run, not as source files.
- Treat personal automation as local infrastructure. It may call a skill, but the staged skill must still work without it.
- Treat generated outputs as user artifacts. Do not commit them unless they are intentionally reviewed examples or fixtures.

## Current Examples

### fpf-work-guide

- Public staged copy: `skills/fpf-work-guide/`.
- User-facing skill README: `skills/fpf-work-guide/README.md`.
- Plugin distribution artifact: `plugins/fpf-work-guide/`.
- Installed operational copy: `$HOME/.agents/skills/fpf-work-guide/`, `$REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills/fpf-work-guide/`, `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/fpf-work-guide/`, or another agent-specific runtime location.
- Runtime dependency layer: shell utilities and `git`.
- Cache and state layer: `${FPF_CACHE_HOME:-${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/cache}/fpf-spec-mirror`, `${FPF_CACHE_HOME:-${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/cache}/codex-skills-and-protocols`, `.fpf-update/`, and `~/.local/state/codex-fpf/`.
- Personal automation layer: workspace launchers, session-start hooks, LaunchAgents, and update jobs that call `fpf-work-guide`.

`fpf-work-guide` personal automation is not a public skill overlay. It must not be staged under `skills/fpf-work-guide/`, and the public skill must not require it.

`fpf-work-guide` refresh decisions are partly state-driven. `latest.env` records the last refresh attempt, TTL, next eligible refresh time, and source commits. `latest-output.env` records wrapper-captured gate output for local status inspection and must not replace the durable gate state file. `environment.env` records the local environment fingerprint used by the doctor and refresh gate. These files may exist both in a workspace state directory such as `.fpf-update/` and in a personal launcher state directory such as `~/.local/state/codex-fpf/`. The refresh gate reads a secondary launcher/global state file only when `FPF_REFRESH_AUTO_STATE_FILE` is explicitly set, and it reports the actual previous-attempt source as `FPF_REFRESH_LAST_ATTEMPT_STATE_PATH`. They are evidence carriers for local operation, not public source files.

When state is unavailable, the refresh gate must classify that as `state-dir-unavailable`. It must not report it as `active-refresh`, because an unwritable state path and a real concurrent refresh are different operational conditions.

The public behavior model for task admission, substantive versus non-substantive interactions, and refresh-gate event semantics is [fpf-work-guide-behavior-model.md](fpf-work-guide-behavior-model.md). It is public skill documentation, not a personal automation layer.

### doc-to-md

- Public staged copy: `skills/doc-to-md/`.
- User-facing skill README: `skills/doc-to-md/README.md`.
- Plugin distribution artifact: `plugins/doc-to-md/`.
- Installed operational copy: `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/doc-to-md/`, `$HOME/.agents/skills/doc-to-md/`, `$REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills/doc-to-md/`, or another agent-specific runtime location.
- Private local policy file: for example `private/local-policies/doc-to-md.md`.
- Runtime dependency layer: MarkItDown core venv, optional book/OCR venvs, `~/.local/bin` wrappers, Tesseract, Ghostscript, and related external tools.
- Generated output layer: Markdown files, OCR PDFs, audit bundles, conversion reports, extracted assets, and comparison artifacts.

`doc-to-md` uses one public skill, not a required public/private pair of skills. Reusable workflow profiles such as `Standard Local Document Profile` and `Textbook Audit + OCR Profile` belong in the public skill. Personal preferences, such as preferring `eng+rus` for the author's English/Russian OCR materials, belong in private local policy and must not become universal public defaults.
