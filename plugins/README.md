# Plugins

This directory contains Codex plugin distribution artifacts.

Plugins are the packaging layer for sharing reusable skills beyond one local checkout or one repo-scoped `.agents/skills` folder. A plugin may bundle one or more skills and, later, optional app mappings, MCP server configuration, lifecycle hooks, and presentation assets.

Current plugins:

| Plugin | Purpose | Runtime notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`fpf-latest`](fpf-latest/) | Distributes the public `fpf-latest` skill as an installable Codex plugin. | Skill-only package. No bundled hooks, apps, or MCP servers. Requires Bash and Git for fresh refresh. |

The repo-local marketplace is defined at [`../.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`](../.agents/plugins/marketplace.json).
